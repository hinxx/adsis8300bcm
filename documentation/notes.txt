Klemen about BCM probes:

Luckily there are probe channel that can help you determine if the pulse has indeed come within the right window. I suggest that you set:
probe1 - register 0x550 to decimal value 10, this will allow you to observe the trigger input on probe 1. Note that this is single bit value, you will get 1 or 0!
probe2 - register 0x650 to decimal value 11, this will allow you to observe window where beam is expected. Note that this is single bit value, you will get 1 or 0!

First plot the channels together with probe1 and probe2 and make sure that the pulse is indeed within the allowed time window.

Keep in mind that adc0-adc7 are signed values and adc8-9 are unsigned.

Here are also some other configuration for the probes (for the reference):

    0..9: ADC channel values with offset removed
      10: Trigger input
      11: SINGLE BITS: Window where beam is expected
      12: SINGLE BITS: Time windows where lower threshold and flattop current measurement is active
      13: SINGLE BITS: Time window for charge measurement and NOT errant pulse detection
      14: SINGLE BITS: Time window for inhibit baseliene tracking, dependent on (calibration ON or OFF)
      15: SINGLE BITS: Raw alarm bits [15:0] (not latched)
  16..25 (0x10..0x17): Processed ADC values
      26: Storage trigger and busy signal
      27: Calibration signals
      28: MPS interlock unlatched
      29: clk_aux sampled with 88M: will show 125 Mhz - 88.0525 MHz = 36.9475 MHz (noisy!)
      30: Reserve
      31: Reserve
      36: Fiber input 0
      37: Fiber input 1
      38: Relax amplification (see av4_relax_diff_at_slope_in)
      63: Always 16384


Matthias about ADC Scale factor:

Where the scale factor (i.e 0x6400) come from:

- 100 mA beam current ==> 1V at the ADC Input ==> 32768 at ADC Output (for exact analogue scale factors)
- The shape output is specified in [mA/256] Units, so 100 mA correspond to 25600
- As the scale factor is in 2^-15 Units (0x8000 will translate ADC values 1:1 to the shape output),
  the scale factor 0x6400 will translate 32768 ADC units to 25600 units at the shape output as desired.


[Hooman]    I did some tests and it turned out that the ADC output reaches its max with an input
            voltage of ~1.1 V. So, in order to get the current value in mA, do we need to slightly
            change the division factor (i.e. 256)? Or should we expect this to be done automatically
            through calibration?
[Matthias]  This is done "automatically" through calibration: calibration will adapt the "0x6400
            scale factor" by a Software algorithm. The division factors for output ports are
            fixed numbers (i.e. 256).

[Hooman]    Is the 0x6400 scale factor a “set-and-don’t-change” value? In other words: if we set
            it to another value, does it mean that part of the FW may not work correctly?

[Matthias]  This is a factor which has to be adapted to do the calibration. It compensates all
            deviations of scales from the beam current to the ADC raw values.

[Hooman]    It seems there are several other parameters in the FW that need to be converted
            to appropriate units for the sake of display on the operator screen. That includes
            ex. the offset, droop, measured pulse width etc. Can you please give some
            clarification on what are the conversion factors?

[Matthias]  Please have a look into the header of file ESS_BCM_TOP.vhd (my original version I
            put it into the ESS bitbucket) where abbreviations and all ports are described
            - the units are described there in the rectangular brackets: i.e. the unit for
            measured pulse width is "1/88M".

            See the explanations in the header: <"1/88M" means 1/88.0525 MHz = 11.35686 ns>
            ==> pulse width is given in 11.35686 ns units (which is one "88 MHz" clock cycle).
